renormalization
===============

Renormalization Group (RG) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) examples.

These are not meant to be very efficient, but demonstrate how the concepts work.

Examples
--------
* cointoss.py: Example of Bayesian statistics for a coin flip.
* polyfit.py: Fitting a polynomial using Bayesian statistics and gradient descent methods.
* ising.py: 2d Ising model using Hopfield network.
